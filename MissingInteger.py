'''
Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive 
integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given:

  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 6
  A[3] = 4
  A[4] = 1
  A[5] = 2
the function should return 5.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage 
required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.

def solution(A):
    ''' Solve it with Pigeonhole principle.
        There are N integers in the input. So for the
        first N+1 positive integers, at least one of
        them must be missing.

    # We only care about the first N+1 positive integers.
    # occurrence[i] is for the integer i+1.
    occurrence = [False] * (len(A) + 1)
    for item in A:
        if 1 <= item <= len(A) + 1:
            occurrence[item-1] = True
 
    # Find out the missing minimal positive integer.
    for index in xrange(len(A) + 1):
        if occurrence[index] == False:
            return index + 1
 
    raise Exception("Should never be here.")
    return -1
