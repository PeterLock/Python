Short Problem Definition:

Simulate a cannon shooting and heaps of falling cannonballs

Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(H+M+N)
expected worst-case space complexity is O(H+M)

Execution:
The obvious brute force solution would be to check the minimum index that is
high enough to block the shot. This would result in a N*M runtime. Based on 
observation we can see that the hit location can be precomputed and it changes
only with small steps.

-1 in the hit_location means, that the ball either ricochets or flies above the highest peak
anything that hits the 0th index also does nothing
